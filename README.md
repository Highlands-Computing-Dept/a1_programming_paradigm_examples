# U1 Activity 1: Programming Paradigms

Produce a formal presentation (with supporting notes) for AQDS that explores the features and characteristics of the three different programming paradigms – Event Driven, Object Oriented and Procedural – in a selected application. The selected application source code will need to implement all three paradigms.

Your presentation should include:

- a brief explanation about what the selected application is and what it does
- a general discussion of the three code paradigms, with specific reference to their characteristics and how each one is related
- a comparison of how the three programming paradigms have been used in the given application source code
- a critical evaluation of how the source code implements all three paradigms in terms of code structure and characteristics.
